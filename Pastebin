        Jungle Survival RPG — Full Story Outline
Act 1: Awakening and Exploration
Setting: You wake up on a sandy riverbank with a mysterious dead radio beside you, surrounded by dense jungle and strange magical energies.

Start Scene: Player chooses between exploring the forest, following the river, climbing an outcrop, or inspecting the radio.

Purpose: Introduce basic movement, inventory, simple puzzles (like filling the flask), and minor encounters.

Events:

Discovering useful items (e.g., Grimwore book, treasure map).

Meeting small enemies (wild animals, jungle predators).

Unlocking crafting basics at the treehouse.

Mini-boss: First boss fight triggered after following the growl to a clearing — the Panther of the Wilds. (Boss 1: Fast and agile, tests combat basics.)

Act 2: The Mystical Forest Depths
Setting: After surviving the Panther, you venture deeper into the mystical forest where reality warps and magic pulses in the air.

New Features: Introduce puzzles involving magical glyphs or riddles that guard paths or treasure.

Random Events:

Puzzle traps where failure causes combat with aggressive forest spirits or venomous creatures.

Enchanted shrines offering either blessings or curses, affecting stats or mana.

Finding armor sets: choose between pairs like BarkhideVest (balanced) or WornScoutJacket (nimble).

Side Quests: Follow mysterious whispers or visions leading to hidden caches or lore.

Mini-boss: The Forest Wraith — a spectral guardian with stealth and magic attacks. (Boss 2: Tests player’s magic resistance and dodging.)

Act 3: Ancient Ruins and Trials
Setting: The forest opens to ancient ruins — remnants of a lost civilization that wielded powerful arcane technology.

Events:

Complex multi-step puzzles involving activating ancient machinery or decoding runes.

Consequences for failure: traps, curses, or immediate death leading to game-over.

Combat against corrupted constructs and guardians.

Discover powerful weapons like StormSplitter or NightReaver.

Random Event: A crafting station allowing combination of rare materials into upgraded gear.

Mini-boss: The Arcane Golem — slow but devastating, with heavy defense and area attacks. (Boss 3: Focus on endurance and strategy.)

Act 4: The Shadowed Peak
Setting: Climbing a towering mystical mountain where the air crackles with chaotic magic and shadows twist reality.

Challenges:

Final, most difficult puzzles testing everything learned (logic, timing, resource management).

Combat-heavy zones with elite enemies, including shadow assassins and enchanted beasts.

Choice between armor sets like PhantomCoat (stealth) or BattleForgedPlates (tank).

Random Events:

Finding legendary weapons: DragonspineExecutioner, MirrorEdge, or Bloodthirster.

Events offering buffs or debuffs based on player’s choices.

Final Boss: The Voidwalker — a terrifying entity controlling void energy and time. (Boss 4: Ultimate challenge, requires mastering all combat and puzzle skills.)

Finale: Escape from the Jungle
After defeating the Voidwalker, the forest/mystical jungle begins to collapse or fade.

Player must make a final choice or series of actions to find the exit portal or path back to civilization.

Optional epilogue depending on collected items, decisions, or surviving companions.
